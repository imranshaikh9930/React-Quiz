# Quiz App

A simple, gamified quiz application built with React. This app fetches quiz data from an API and presents multiple-choice questions to the user. It tracks the number of correct answers, displays the correct answer when a wrong option is selected, and allows users to navigate through the quiz.

## Features

- **Dynamic Questions:** Quiz data is fetched from an API endpoint.
- **Answer Validation:** Correct answers are tracked and displayed upon wrong selections.
- **Navigation:** Users can move to the next question or reset the quiz once completed.
- **Visual Feedback:** Selected options are highlightedâ€”green for correct, red for incorrect.
- **Error Handling:** Displays error messages if a user attempts to move forward without selecting an option.
